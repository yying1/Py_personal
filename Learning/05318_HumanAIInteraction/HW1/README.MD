# Assignment #1 Setup Instructions

## Step #1 Install Anaconda
Anaconda will have all the libraries as well as Jupyter notebooks that we will use in this assignment. Follow the instructions to install on your machine here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

## Step #2 Download homework files
Download the `ipynb` notebook file in this repository as well as `data.zip`. Place both of these files into a well-named folder on your computer, and click on the zip file to unzip the data folder.

## Step #3 (Terminal Option)
In your terminal, navigate to your homework folder and run `jupyter notebook .` to start the notebook. A notebook session should open up in your browser.

## Step #3 (Graphical User Interface Option)
Once Anaconda is installed on your machine, open an application called Anaconda-Navigator. On the main page, click the 'launch' button on the Jupyter Notebook tile. A notebook session should open up in your browser.
