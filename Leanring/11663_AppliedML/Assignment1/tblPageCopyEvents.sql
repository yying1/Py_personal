1	1661691	Smoking is the most common method of consuming tobacco, and tobacco is the most common substance smoked.
2	1661705	Rates of consumption from 1965 onward in the developed world have either peaked or declined.[6] However, they continue to climb in the developing world.[7]
3	1661720	The resulting vapors are then inhaled and the active substances absorbed through the alveoli in the lungs.[9] The active substances trigger chemical reactions in nerve endings which hightens heart rate, memory, alertness,[10] and reaction time.[11] Dopamine and later endorphins are released, which are often associated with pleasure.
4	1661752	Many smokers begin during adolescence or early adulthood. Usually during the early stages, smoking provides pleasurable sensations, serving as a source of positive reinforcement. After some individual have smoked for many years, the avoidance of withdrawal symptoms and negative reinforcement become the key motivations.
5	1661786	Tobacco use leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer)
6	1661866	When tobacco use in the movies and on television is portrayed as fun, exciting, sexy, rebellious or connected to wealth and power, it reinforces common advertising themes of the tobacco industry. While glamorizing tobacco may not be the intent of the entertainment industry, the end result is that such portrayal encourages tobacco use among young people.
7	1661892	Extensive tobacco use in movies and television suggests that smoking is more common in society than it actually is.
8	1662076	National Organization for Tobacco Eradication (NOTE) has issued a statement to the official broadcasters of IPL matches to avoid showing Shahrukh Khan smoking in the Stadium during the IPL match on April 21

12	1662417	At least 2,200 people die daily from tobacco-related diseases in India, a nation of 1.1 billion people boasting the world's highest number of cinema attendances.
13	1662501	Tobacco brands in Indian movies nearly triple after advertising ban Despite film industry promises to self-police tobacco promotion on screen, tobacco brands popped up in more than 40 percent of Indian films released since 2004. That is almost triple the 15 percent incidence observed before the enforcement of a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. As per the research study by the Chandigarh based NGO, Burning Brain Society and supported by WHO, 89 percent of the films released and analyzed after the tobacco advertising ban included generic or branded tobacco imagery. This is significantly up from the 76 percent of Indian films with tobacco as reported by the WHO study in 2003.
14	1662515	To gauge the effect of this on-screen hype, the study surveyed more than 1,100 children, adolescents and young adults. One in three of these were able to recall seeing a particular tobacco brand in an Indian film.
15	1662530	This is even noticeable in the attitude of some youngsters who have still not experimented with tobacco but admitted imitating smoking behaviour of the movie characters, thinking it to be fashionable and imitable. Nearly 60 percent of the children and youngsters admitted using articles like pen or pencil akin a cigarette in their hand in emulation of some movie actor smoking. On the issue of creativity, an overwhelming 96 percent said that tobacco's absence from a film would not lessen the film's quality or make them less eager to see it.

20	1662873	Bernoulli's Principle
21	1662930	Bernoulli's Principle is a physical phenomenon that was named after the Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli who lived during the eighteenth century. Bernoulli studied the relationship of the speed of a fluid and pressure. The principle states that "the pressure of a fluid [liquid or gas] decreases as the speed of the fluid increases." Within the same fluid (air in the example of aircraft moving through air), high-speed flow is associated with low pressure, and low-speed flow is associated with high pressure.
22	1662940	This phenomenon applies to the lift produced by the wing of an airplane, i.e., an airfoil. The airfoil is designed so that the air moves more rapidly over its upper surface than its lower surface, thereby decreasing pressure above the airfoil. At the same time, the impact of the air on the lower surface of the airfoil increases the pressure below the airfoil. This difference between the decreased pressure above and the increased pressure below produces lift. Thus, a wing with more curvature on the top surface (greater camber) has greater lift than a wing with flat surfaces.

42	1666812	The format of IPL Cricket tournaments has become increasingly popular among the cricket fans. One reason perhaps is the relatively shorter time span required for watching the game. Another factor seems to be that the pace of the game is now much quicker than before, leading to more exciting play from the players' as well as viewers' perspective. As a result of these factors, the ODI and Test Cricket formats are now relatively less popular and the International Cricket community might have to take note of this and adapt accordingly by conducting tournaments at the international level that cater to the needs of viewers and players who have taken a liking to the new IPL format.

58	1668076	Short-sightedness or myopia If your cornea is too curved, or your eyeball too long, light rays from distant objects focus in front of your retina. This makes objects seem fuzzy or blurred. Nearby objects don't look fuzzy, because the light rays enter your eye at a slight angle. This means they focus on your retina properly.
59	1668086	nearsightedness
60	1668139	Myopia usually develops in children or young teenagers. You are more likely to develop myopia if it runs in your family. Temporary short-sightedness, called pseudomyopia, can be caused by certain diseases or drugs. For example, myopia can be the first sign of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes. Pseudomyopia usually clears up if the underlying cause is treated.
61	1668143	Shortsightedness often develops in rapidly growing school-aged children and becomes worse during the teenage years, requiring frequent changes in prescription glasses or contact lenses to maintain clear vision. Shortsightedness usually stabilizes as the body stops growing in the early twenties. A person who has developed shortsightedness may experience blurred vision, headaches, eyestrain, or frequent squinting. Uncorrected shortsightedness may cause a person to feel fatigued after driving, watching television, or playing sports.
62	1668194	The treatment for this eye condition depends upon several factors, including the patient‚Äôs age, occupation, and activities. Eye doctors most commonly correct shortsightedness with corrective lenses, such as prescription glasses or contact lenses, which compensate for the elongated shape of the eye and allow light to focus properly on the retina. Depending on the degree of shortsightedness, corrective lenses may have to be worn all the time for clear vision. If the degree of impairment is slight, however, glasses or contacts may only be necessary for activities which require distant vision, such as driving, watching TV, or reading a chalkboard.
63	1668208	Recently, refractive surgery has become a popular option for reducing or eliminating the need for corrective lenses. The most common type of refractive surgery is laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), in which the surgeon cuts a small flap in the top of the cornea, an excimer laser takes off some of the corneal tissue, and the flap is then replaced. Another form of refractive surgery is photorefractive keratectomy (PKR), in which an excimer laser removes a layer of corneal tissue to flatten the cornea. Both procedures allow light rays to focus correctly on the retina.
64	1668237	Eyeglasses, contact lenses, and refractive surgery are the primary options to treat the visual symptoms of those with myopia.
65	1668254	Orthokeratology is the practice of using special rigid contact lenses to flatten the cornea to reduce myopia. Occasionally, pinhole glasses are used by patients with low-level myopia. These work by reducing the blur circle formed on the retina, but their adverse effects on peripheral vision, contrast and brightness make them unsuitable in most situations.

These work by reducing the blur circle formed on the retina, but their adverse effects on peripheral vision, contrast and brightness make them unsuitable in most situations.
67	1668395	Color blindness, or colour blindness, a color vision deficiency, is the inability to perceive differences between some of the colors that others can distinguish. It is most often of genetic nature, but may also occur because of eye, nerve, or brain damage, or exposure to certain chemicals.
68	1668424	Unfortunately, there is no cure for hereditary color vision deficiency. If you have color vision deficiency, it is possible for you to learn to recognize color by other means. Some people learn to tell colors apart by brightness or location. Also, there are specially tinted eyeglasses that may help you to tell certain colors apart.
69	1668449	Color vision is possible due to photoreceptors in the retina of the eye known as cones. These cones have light sensitive pigments that enable us to recognize color. Found in the macula, the central portion of the retina, each cone is sensitive to either red, green or blue light, which the cones recognize based upon light wavelengths. Normally, the pigments inside the cones register differing colors and send that information through the optic nerve to the brain enabling you to distinguish countless shades of color. But if the cones lack one or more light sensitive pigments, you will be unable to see one or more of the three primary colors thereby causing a deficiency in your color perception.
70	1668469	Usually, color deficiency is an inherited condition caused by a common X-linked recessive gene, which is passed from a mother to her son. But disease or injury damaging the optic nerve or retina can also result in loss of color recognition.
71	1668483	There is no cure for inherited color deficiency. But if the cause is an illness or eye injury, treating these conditions may improve color vision. Using special tinted eyeglasses or wearing a red tinted contact lens on one eye can increase some people's ability to differentiate between colors, though nothing can make you truly see the deficient color. Most color deficient persons compensate for their inability to distinguish certain colors with color cues and details that are not consciously evident to people with normal color vision. There are ways to work around the inability to see certain colors by: * Organizing and labeling clothing, furniture or other colored objects (with the help of friends or family) for ease of recognition. * Remembering the order of things rather than their color can also increase the chances of correctly identifying colors. For example a traffic light has red on top, yellow in the middle and green on the bottom. Though color vision deficiency can be a frustration and may limit participation in some occupations, in most cases it is not a serious threat to vision and can be adapted to your lifestyle with time, patience and practice.
72	1668522	There are three main kinds of color vision defects. Red-green color vision defects are the most common. This type occurs in men more than in women. The other major types are blue-yellow color vision defects and a complete absence of color vision.

193	1751893	Cricket seems to be undergoing perpetual innovations ‚Äì from test to one-day and now the T20, which has revolutionized cricket and added much more entertainment, drama and glamour to the sport.
194	1751901	The first ever cricket tournaments were all held in the Test Cricket format, going on for about five days. From these test matches were born the one-day matches, which subsequently out-did Test Cricket in popularity. Since they were of a short duration, the game was much faster and, therefore, much more thrilling. However, the latest revolution in cricket has been the 20-20 cricket matches . Commonly known as the T20, it shot to popularity with the very first match, so much so that T20 now has its own World Cup!
195	1751915	The primary reason why T20 is so popular among cricket fans is because of the drama and the thrill which the forty overs deliver. Since each side gets only twenty overs, the pace of the game is very fast. Every over is action-packed and every inning is a knock-out. Without a single dull moment, it manages to keep the spectators at the edge of their seat throughout.
196	1751997	T20 cricket has also brought in a new generation of cricketers, namely T20 experts. Cricketers proficient in power hitting from ball one have become extremely important. The inaugural world t20 cup held in South Africa in 2007 was a very successful sporting event. Since then, the popularity of this version has skyrocketed. The highly successful Indian premier league was started by the BCCI in 2008. This is an annual event. The 2008 version brought over a billion dollars in revenues to everyone involved.
197	1752006	The popularity of the other forms of the game are waning. People like to enjoy the shortened games because of the glamor and fun involved. There are cheerleaders for every team who cheer every wicket, four or six. Popular songs are blasted on the stadium speakers. The shorter boundaries help more aerial shots and hence the fun. Even girls are watching this version of cricket which wasn't the case earlier. Popular celebrities are called in to give their views on TV and this has helped increase the mass appeal of the game. It is not just technique, but more of slam-bang. More new younger players are getting the chance to play for big teams. Thus twenty 20 cricket has proved to be very successful both in terms of money and public support. It is here to stay.

199	1755084	fluid dynamics is a sub-discipline of fluid mechanics that deals with fluid flow‚Äîthe natural science of fluids (liquids and gases) in motion. It has several subdisciplines itself, including aerodynamics (the study of air and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of liquids in motion).
200	1755177	The foundational axioms of fluid dynamics are the conservation laws, specifically, conservation of mass, conservation of linear momentum (also known as Newton's Second Law of Motion), and conservation of energy (also known as First Law of Thermodynamics)

203	1755813	Watching movies, videos, and DVDs can be a fun activity in which children and adolescents can use their imagination and fantasy. Parents should, however, consider the following issues when planning to watch movies at a theatre or at home:
204	1755821	Although going to a movie theater can be exciting, movies can create anxiety for children with loud noises and frightening and upsetting scenes.
205	1755836	Viewing movies with sex, violence, drug abuse, adult themes, and offensive language can have a negative effect on children and adolescents. Many movies are not appropriate for children or teenagers.
206	1755861	Over the past two decades, hundreds of studies have examined how violent programming on TV affects children and young people. While a direct "cause and effect" link is difficult to establish, there is a growing consensus that some children may be vulnerable to violent images and messages.
207	1755877	Researchers have identified three potential responses to media violence in children:
208	1755885	Increased fear‚Äîalso known as the "mean and scary world" syndrome
209	1755893	Desensitization to real-life violence
210	1755901	Increased aggressive behaviour
211	1755909	Parents should also pay close attention to what their children see in the news since studies have shown that kids are more afraid of violence in news coverage than in any other media content. Fear based on real news events increases as children get older and are better able to distinguish fantasy from reality.
212	1755969	It is everywhere you look. Turn on the television, it‚Äôs there. Go to a movie, it‚Äôs there. Even a cartoon that a five year old watches is filled with it. Media violence. Movie plots often revolve around violence and television programs are making violence increasingly more popular. The witnessing of daily acts of violence is now taking a toll on the youth of today. By the time a child turns 18, they will have witnessed 16,000 murders and 200,000 acts of violence on television alone. Often times, these programs do not show the consequences of these acts of violence, either. Only five percent of children‚Äôs programs depict the long-term consequences of aggressive behavior. In addition, 58 percent of the time the victims were not shown suffering from pain. Therefore, the children who watch these programs will think that there is no consequences for resorting to violence

217	1764362	T20 is still in its nascent stage at the international level and probably things will change further in the years to come, but a few basic things that have emerged out of T20 world would probably remain the same. And I hope so, because that is good for cricket. One of such things is the end of dominance of a few teams over others.
218	1764374	In the longer format of the game, even if you make some mistakes, there is time for you to recover, your team and the captain can plan out counter attacking strategies. But such luxuries are not accepted by T20. Such basic things have allowed us to see surprises more often which in fact are not surprises, because there have been far too many. This probably is the core of T20. And probably this would be the reason for T20 to be a huge success.
219	1764509	The financial security of the game was, at a stroke, assured. But all was not well at the home of cricket. Twenty20 had been accepted - or at least tolerated - as a rather silly little sideline which brought in the cash, but now it was threatening to take over, challenging the popularity of the highest form of the game: the Test Match.

220	1764519	The traditionalists rebelled. Mocking Twenty20 as a ‚Äòhit and giggle‚Äô event. A brief festival of slogging and rushes of blood to the head, incomparable to the Test Match and its unique demands on technique and concentration.

221	1764529	The Test has somehow come to be regarded as the natural, or proper form of the game. But even Test cricket itself was not played until 1876 - perhaps 300 years after the inception of the sport.

222	1764729	The future of One Day International (ODI) cricket seems to be very uncertain. The effects of Twenty20 cricket (a.k.a Pro20 or T20) seem to be having a negative influence on the ODI game. Cricket Australia has said that the 2015 Cricket World Cup scheduled for Australia is not marketable. The England Cricket Board has scarped their domestic 50-over competition and replaced it with a 40-over game, while in South Africa we play a 45 over game in the MTN Domestic Championships.
223	1764737	There is simply too much Twenty20 cricket on the go, this year we‚Äôve watched our domestic Twenty20 competition (the Standard Bank Pro20), the Indian Premier League (IPL), the ICC World Twenty20, and we‚Äôll soon watch the Champions League and a few Twenty20 Internationals. That simply is more that a cricket enthusiast can absorb. I do believe there is a place for Twenty20 cricket, it should be use to grow the game and be used as an exhibition, the IPL, Champions league and world cups should be played where cricket is young and needs to be developed.

226	1764914	Cataracts: Your eye has a lens that helps it to focus. The lens is made of protein. When protein molecules clump, a cloudy spot (called a cataract) forms. This is common in older people. Because cataracts grow slowly, your eye doctor may simply monitor a cataract until it interferes with your vision. Cataract surgery is a very common procedure to remove the cataract from your eye.
227	1764924	Dry Eye: Your eyelids have lacrimal glands that produce tears, and they drain into your tear ducts in your lower eyelids. If your lacrimal glands stop working well, your eyes will become dry and uncomfortable. Eye drops can help, but have your eyes checked. There may be a simple procedure to partially plug your tear ducts (to keep tears from draining too fast).
228	1764933	Glaucoma: The eye is filled with fluid. If too much pressure develops in the eye, it is called glaucoma. Over time, this build-up of pressure can damage the optic nerve and cause blindness. Luckily, this pressure develops slowly and routine eye exams can detect glaucoma before it becomes dangerous.
229	1764966	Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide, and the leading cause of vision loss in the United States. ‚Äî "Improving the Nation's Vision Health: A Coordinated Public Health Approach," Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006. An estimated 20.5 million Americans of ages 40 and older (17.2 percent) have a cataract in one or both eyes and 6.1 million (5.1 percent) have had cataract surgery. ‚Äî "Improving The Nation's Vision Health: A Coordinated Public Health Approach," Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006. By age 80, more than half of all Americans have cataracts. ‚Äî "Vision Problems in the U.S.: Prevalence of Adult Vision Impairment and Age-Related Eye Disease in America," Prevent Blindness America and National Eye Institute, 2002. It's estimated that 30.1 million Americans will have cataracts by 2020.‚Äî "Improving The Nation's Vision Health: A Coordinated Public Health Approach," Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006.
230	1764976	It's estimated that 2.2 million Americans age 40 and older are affected by open-angle glaucoma. ‚Äî "Improving the Nation's Vision Health: A Coordinated Public Health Approach," Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness among African Americans. ‚Äî "Improving The Nation's Vision Health: A Coordinated Public Health Approach," Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006.
231	1765054	Dry eye or dry eye syndrome occurs when tears cannot be properly produced by the eye or when tears evaporate too fast. Sometimes dry eye is also associated with inflammation of the eye. Without treatment, dry eye can result in pain, ulcers, cornea scars and loss of vision to some extent. Some treatments for dry eye include taking medication, switching contact lenses, plugging drainage holes in the eye or minor surgery.

234	1773654	What i feel is that IPL is no doubt a business where the people with big pockets that just multiply their money, BCCI also is just supporting and encouraging Cricket only, But then if u see from the other side then, If u see then the start of IPL has given employment to so many individuals who can work, it has also supported the Media of the country to grow as the TRP rates of the channels have gone up tremendously, which is indirectly going to earn revenues for the government in some way or the other, where as, the BCCI are only giving the people of India wat they want to see and that is entertainment, where as BCCI has also stated that it is going to promote the National Sport that is Hockey by the profits that it earns from the IPL so that the people of the country also gain more amount of interest in it also, At the end i would just like to ask one simple question If sports are not providing growth to the government that why does the government promote it? IPL being claimed as the costliest Cricket tournament in the world is of course going to earn huge revenues for the government...
235	1773798	EING THE growing popularity of both Indian Premier League (IPL) and Indian Cricket League (ICL), one can easily say that the future of cricket has something new to offer with these leagues. Although both have a rivalry between them, something that is gaining from this is the Indian cricket, as new players will get a doorway to enter into the big field by performing well in domestic seasons and then getting into IPL or ICL. One cannot put aside the thought that in the future, cricket between two countries might come to an end and just like football, there would be one world cup in four years involving different countries, while the rest of time there will be championships just like English or the Spanish Federation cups. Moreover with the growing popularity of twenty-twenty (T-20) cricket, one can say that test cricket and even one day cricket will get dampened as one can expect a lower turnout of people coming to watch a test match as compared to that of a T20 match. But would this be good for cricket? Would the real classic cricket prevail? To answer these, one has to look carefully on both sides of the coin. Yes, one can say that the real endurance of cricketers would not get tested under T-20 match, as the game finishes off within three hours, while test cricket involves a whole day of play. Most of the critics believe in having a blend of both T20 matches and test matches so that the real essence of cricket never loses its luster, as both have their own merits and demerits. Raza said, ‚ÄúDefinitely test cricket is better than twenty-twenty as the all round skills of a cricketer and patience are best tested under test cricket while in T-20, more than the skills, the luck factor remains predominant. On his day, one can perform superbly well while on others, he may fail miserably.‚Äù On asking one of the fans, Kamal said, ‚ÄúTwenty- twenty is far better than test cricket. In this busy world, who has the time to watch a cricket match for five whole tedious days and see the result of the match ending in a draw? It‚Äôs not only a wastage of time on the part of the viewers but also results in lack of fun or excitement, on the contrary twenty-twenty is fun and every ball brings goosebumps to the audience.‚Äù So one cannot fathom the feelings of everyone as to what should be there and what should not be there, as many believe that cricket between two nation puts the relation between the two countries at stake as it was in the case of recent Indian-Australian tour when the matter became a national issue. Moreover, sledging that has become so common in cricket is more common between different playing nations as compared to the present time when we see players from different nations playing together under IPL and ICL. So is IPL and ICL the right path to be adopted for future? Or should there be a proper proportion between the traditional test cricket and twenty-twenty cricket? This is something, which International Cricket Council (ICC) needs to look into.

237	1773879	hat will be the impact of the much-hyped Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament on media buyers in India? And, how will media agencies handle additional responsibilities? According to media agency chief honchos, the media planning and buying fraternity have been hugely impacted by this whole phenomenon called IPL in the last few days. ‚ÄúWith such huge investments involved in the event, this was bound to happen. However, the market is a bit skeptical about the kind of interest a 59 match tournament, with regional teams being involved, can generate in the form of viewer ship,‚Äù said Sudha Natrajan, joint president of Lintas Media Group. While Lintas Media is partnering with its clients to check out the best possible opportunities on the tournament, other advertising majors are beefing up their operations to handle additional work. According to Punitha Arumugam, group CEO of Madison Media, the scale of ‚Äòword of mouth‚Äô and news headlines generated by IPL have been unprecedented. ‚ÄúThis combined with continuous prime time telecast beginning April 18 to June 1 is likely to fragment prime time viewer ship. IPL is likely to make clients to upfront budgets in April-May thereby affecting the revenue stream of other channels in 2008.The tournament is expected to revive the normal dip in overall TV viewership that happens during the summer,‚Äù she added. On the impact of IPL on media buying agencies, Chandradeep Mitra, president, Optimum Media Solutions (OMS), Mudra said: ‚ÄúThe impact will depend on the client/category, their selling seasons, their budgets, their competitors and their target consumers. The final picture, with its impact on ratings, spot rates, and media plans and buys, will start emerging after a week of IPL‚Äôs start,‚Äù he explained. According to Pratap Bose, chief executive officer of Ogilvy & Mather India (O&M), the media and advertising fraternity are eying the IPL spectacle with bated breath and huge deal of expectancy. ‚ÄúLarge sporting properties like IPL could be the precursor of change in the way media is bought and delivered in the future,‚Äù he added. Sharing similar views, Natrajan said: ‚ÄúIt has been difficult for media agencies, as they do not have any bench mark to evaluate against to project what this tournament will deliver, as nothing like this has been attempted before.‚Äù Incidentally, Lintas Media Group has done a comprehensive analysis to chalk out its action plan for its clients.
